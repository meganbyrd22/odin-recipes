The Odin Project - Recipes Project for HTML and CSS skill development 

The recipes project was the first project completed as part of The Odin Project Fundamentals course. 
The project is a very basic website created with HTML and later updated with CSS. The website includes a main page with a list of links to 3 recipes and one page per recipe. Each recipe page includes a picture, description, ingredients and instructions.

-Core skills: HTML, CSS, Git

-Detailed skills: HTML file creation via Git, HTML boilerplate, multi-page website, link to images, ordered and unordered lists, minimal CSS

Live demo: https://meganbyrd22.github.io/odin-recipes/

(Completed September 2022)

I'm updating this README to test the branch I just made to practice PRs.
